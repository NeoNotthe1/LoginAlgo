Log in page algorithm that shows Double Data entry Verification
I was reading about the importance of Validation and Verification, the methods of both Validation and Verification mitigates the error in computer program or system and as well as of human but only main flaw or drawback is that if the original
source has an error then we can do nothing about it except to just process it. You may find the different types of Verification and Validation methods but I wrote this to emphasize the importance and the minor flaw of their concept,
I have written this program to indicate the Double Data entry Verification from the computer, well if you have any changes to make you can make it freely, I would be glad if you have any idea to make the program more complex or even 
to find my mistake.

I hope you guys like it!
HAPPY CODING!!!
